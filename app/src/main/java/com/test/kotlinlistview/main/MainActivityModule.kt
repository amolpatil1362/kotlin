   * @Binds is the replacement for the @Provides
   *if we use @Bind then we will also need to mark our Module as abstract in this case, which is more efficient than a concrete one and thus makes @Binds more efficient.
   * @Provides methods are instance methods and they need an instance of our module in order to be invoked.
   * If our Module is abstract and contains @Binds methods, dagger will not instantiate our module and instead directly use the Provider of our injected parameter
   *
   *
   * In case, your Module has both @Provides and @Binds methods, you have two options :

    1.Simplest would be to mark your @Provides instance methods as static.
    2.If it is necessary to keep them as instance methods, then you can split your module into two and extract out all the @Binds methods into an abstract Module.
